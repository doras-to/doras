Another day, another release! This time we've got some new features, some bug fixes and some improvements to the onboarding process.

## New onboarding

We've added a new panel to the homescreen to help you get set up as simply as possible. This can help you ensure you're using all the awesome tools that Doras has to offer!

## Helpful analytics

We've implemented a new analytics system to help you understand who your fans are, and where they're coming from! This is a great way to understand your audience and help you grow your fanbase.

## Additional

Most of this update is regarding backend features. For example, we implemented [PostHog](https://posthog.com) to help with error tracking and analytics. We also implemented a new system to help with our internal development process.

We've also squished a fair number of bugs, thanks for our awesome community for reporting them!
