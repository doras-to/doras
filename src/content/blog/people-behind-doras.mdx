As we grow, we want to be as transparent as possible. We want to be open about who we are as people, what we're planning and what we're doing. I also want to highlight the people behind Doras, who we are as people, what we're planning, and where we need help.

## Let's meet the team

Before we get into it, you going to see a theme; naval. We felt that traditional roles are very "corpo" speak, and that just doesn't match our vibe. So, we've gone with a naval theme. We're all sailors on the same ship, and we're all working together to get to the same destination.
