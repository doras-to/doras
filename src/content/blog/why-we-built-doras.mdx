## Origins Unveiled

On a fateful day in June 2022, we birthed a tool, YouTube Channel Rewards, under the creative umbrella of the [Gezel](https://gezel.io) company. Initially designed to spice up YouTube streams with channel rewards, it inadvertently birthed the spark for something much grander. Picture this: a bio page creation feature injected into a Chrome extension. Suddenly, we realized the potential extended far beyond YouTube; we had a tool for everyone, not just exclusive to YouTube streamers. And so, the journey of Doras began.

## The Driving Force

In a world filled with Linktree, Beacons, and a myriad of alternatives, we asked ourselves, "How can we stand out?" Enter Mystl.ink, now Doras, a unique platform that goes beyond the ordinary link in bio page. We wanted something distinct, something easy to use, and something that could be the go-to platform for creators everywhere. Mystl.ink introduced the concept of subdomains, offering a personalized touch such as "username.mystl.ink" rather than the mundane "mystl.ink/username".

## The Rebirth: Why Doras?

Mystlink had its run, but the code became unbearable, tangled in outdated frameworks and a web of incomprehensible HTML files. The tedious bug fixes and security concerns led us to a significant overhaul. We switched frameworks, languages, and embraced a component-based approach for clearer, more manageable code. No more self-hosted databases; we've embraced the cloud for enhanced security and peace of mind. Plus, the name "Mystlink" just didn't vibe right; it didn't roll off the tongue. Enter "Doras," the Irish word for "door" and the closest thing to our vision of a digital "portal." It felt right, and so we rebranded, welcoming a new era.

## What Lies Ahead

Doras isn't just about link in bio pages; it's about empowering creators for success. Imagine media kits to secure brand deals, tools to drive traffic, and a community that fuels growth. Our goal is to evolve Doras into a holistic creator service, providing everything you need to thrive. We're on a mission, working hard to make that vision a reality. Welcome to Doras, where simplicity meets endless possibilities. ðŸš€
