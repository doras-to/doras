New week, new update! ðŸš€ I took it upon myself to redesign the entire UI because I wasn't happy how things were headed, so chose now is a good time to do it! Let's go over that first.

## UI Overhaul ðŸŽ¨

#### It's darker ðŸ”¦

Yep, by a good few shades, actually! Just a little touch up to make everything clearer and easier to read.

#### New navigation systems ðŸ§­

This probably took the longest, but here's the rundown:

-   **Sidebar**
    -   Removed the titles on the sidebar and replaced them with tooltips when you hover an icon to help clear up some clutter
    -   Simplified the icons a bit to be more uniform
-   **Navigation**
    -   Modified the top navigation to look a lot cleaner and more modern. Can say I personally took some inspiration from [Vercel](https://vercel.com) here, but I think it looks a lot better than before!
    -   It's now darker to help match contrast
    -   Simplified the buttons in the top right like your user profile and the megaphone menu to integrate better with the UI

Let's take a look! (Left is new, right is old.)

#### Let's not forget about mobile! ðŸ“±

Look, I'll be the first to admit that I wasn't focusing on mobile too much, but I realised that a lot of our traffic comes from mobile, and a lot of our "competition" have things like apps and mobile-friendly sites, so I thought it was about time we did the same!
The main feature here is now that on mobile the sidebar is gone to make more room for everything, and the already improved navigation system is now a lot more mobile-friendly!
Instead of the sidebar, you have a bottom navigation bar that you can use to navigate around the site. It's a lot more intuitive and easier to use, and I think it looks a lot better too!
