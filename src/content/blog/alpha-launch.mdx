## We've hit closed alpha ðŸš€

The day has come, and were so happy! Users who sign up to the waitlist are slowly being let in, and we're getting some great feedback so far. I thought I'd lay out some of the features so ya'll can know what to except when you get in.

## Dashboard

This is a pretty simple page right now with some basic stats and showing you some links on what you can do, as well as a preview of your profile.

## Profiles

Your link in bio is your profile. On the profile tab you can add links, modify how the world sees you, and more. You can also see your stats, like how many clicks you've gotten and how many people have viewed your profile, as well as the design of your profile.

### Links

This is where you can add links and other blocks like text blocks and embeds for things like Twitch and YouTube videos. You can also reorder them and delete them very simply!

### Design

Design is where you can modify the look and feel of things. You can change your display name, picture, bio, and all other sorts. We even rebuilt some custom themes for you to use, and you can even make your own!

### Analytics

This page is pretty bare bones right now, and only shows your lifetime stats such as views, clicks and your click through rate (which is basically the percentage of people who view your profile and click a link). We also show you which links are performing the best, and which ones aren't.

## Your Story

This is a brand new beast introduced to Doras. Your Story is a fully formattable text input where you can write a full article about yourself. Take a look at mine if you aren't sure what you can do: https://doras.to/tommerty/story.

# The Badges

You might have noticed some pages either have a "Beta" or "Alpha" badge. This just helps indicate what level of testing we're at. Alpha is the first stage, and is the most unstable. Beta is the second stage, and is a bit more stable. If a page doesn't have a badge, it's probably pretty stable!

# How to submit feedback

We're still figuring out the best way to leave feedback, but your best option is probably our [Discord server](https://doras.to/discord). Feel free to throw it in #general!

Alternatively, you can create an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/doras-to/doras/issues/new) and we'll be happy to take it on board!

We're excited to continuing development with the feedback provided by you guys, and we hope you enjoy the alpha!
